        <h1>Zachary Baughan</h1>
        <p>My name is <b>Zachary Baughan</b>. I'm currently studying Software Engineering. I originally intended to pursue a Cybersecurity major, although I realized somewhat late that the field of Cybersecurity involves <i>next to no</i> coding, which meant that one of my best skills - being really good with code - would see no use. This, combined with a general loss of interest in Cybersecurity's topics, resulted in me switching not just major, but colleges altogether. Despite the trouble it came with, <u>I think it was a good call to do so in the long run.</u></p>
