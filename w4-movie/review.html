                    Monty Python is a very talented comedy group known for thier hilarious skits and witty humor. Thier work on <em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</em> is no exception. In truth, the movie is effectively a collection of Monty Python skits with a central plot to tie them all together. While this would be a bold direction for any other movie, it only makes sense for a group like Monty Python, and they use the format to it's fullest.

                    The movie may not be everyone's cup of tea - if you prefer movies with deep lore to research and a dramatic story you'll be thinking about months later, <em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail</em> will likely fall short. On the other hand, if you're willing to embrace it's nonsensical and unorthadox nature, then perhaps you'll find yourself a new favorite movie in this masterpiece.
